# X509-REST_Web_Service
A REST Web Service that provides X509 mutual certificate authentication. This web service has an HTTPS endpoint that runs through SSL certificate verification and can recieve and output data in JSON format. The X509 is handled through Spring security and a RESTful API was used to handle the GET and POST requests for the data. 


## RESTful API
A RESTful API explicitly takes advantage of HTTP methodologies defined by the RFC 2616 protocol. They use GET to retrieve a resource; PUT to change the state of or update a resource, which can be an object, file or block; POST to create that resource; and DELETE to remove it.
